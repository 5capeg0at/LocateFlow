      CRITICAL: Before allowing this production code to be saved, verify:
      
      1. Does a corresponding test file exist for this module?
      2. Are there specific tests that justify this code change?
      3. If this is new functionality, are there failing tests that this code will make pass?
      
      If ANY of these are false:
      - REJECT the save operation
      - Explain what tests need to be written first
      - Guide the developer to create the required tests
      
      Follow TDD methodology strictly:
      - No production code without failing tests
      - Tests must be written first
      - Production code should be minimal to make tests pass
      
      Only allow the save if proper tests exist and follow TDD principles.
