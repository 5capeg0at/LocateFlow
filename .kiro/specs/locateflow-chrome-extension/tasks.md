- **Copy Integration:** Event delegation for copy buttons with callback system

#### Quality Metrics:
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite covering positioning, tabs, and keyboard interactions
- **Code Quality:** ESLint compliant, follows SOLID principles with clean separation of concerns
- **Error Handling:** Graceful DOM manipulation with proper cleanup
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript compliance with strict interfaces

#### Files Created:
- `src/content/on-page-popup.ts` - On-page popup UI implementation
- `__tests__/content/on-page-popup.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/adr/ADR-005-on-page-popup-architecture.md` - Architecture decision record

#### Next Agent Context:
- On-page popup UI complete with tabbed interface and keyboard hotkey support
- Smart positioning system prevents UI issues with screen edge detection
- Ready for locator display and copy functionality implementation (Task 5.4)
- Callback system enables integration with element selector and storage components
- ARIA tab foundation established for accessibility snapshot functionality

### Task 5.5: Implement inspection mode management with TDD
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** 2025-07-28

#### TDD Cycle Summary:
- **RED Phase:** Created 24 failing tests defining inspection mode state management and service worker communication
- **GREEN Phase:** Implemented `InspectionModeManager` class with minimal code to pass all tests
- **REFACTOR Phase:** Enhanced documentation, created ADR-004, and improved error handling

#### Requirements Traceability:
- ✅ Requirement 1.1: Extension inspection mode activation with state management
- ✅ Requirement 1.6: Page interaction prevention during inspection mode with event capture
- ✅ Service worker communication for cross-component coordination
- ✅ Callback system for integration with other content script components

#### Architecture Decisions:
- **Single Responsibility Design**: Dedicated class focused solely on inspection mode management
- **Event Capture Strategy**: Capture phase event handling for reliable interaction prevention
- **Service Worker Integration**: Bidirectional message passing with graceful error handling
- **Callback-Based Integration**: Loose coupling with other components through callback registration

#### Implementation Details:
- **Core Class**: `InspectionModeManager` with comprehensive state management capabilities
- **Key Methods**:
  - `activateInspectionMode()` - Enables inspection mode with event listener registration
  - `deactivateInspectionMode()` - Disables inspection mode and cleans up resources
  - `isInspectionModeActive()` - State query method for external components
  - `onModeActivated()/onModeDeactivated()` - Callback registration for integration
- **Event Handling**: Click and submit event prevention during inspection mode
- **Service Worker Communication**: Message passing for `INSPECTION_MODE_ACTIVATED` and `INSPECTION_MODE_DEACTIVATED`
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling for DOM operations and service worker communication

#### Quality Metrics:
- **Test Coverage**: 100% statement coverage with 24 comprehensive test cases
- **Tests**: 24/24 passing with edge cases and error scenarios covered
- **Code Quality**: ESLint compliant, follows SOLID principles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all failure scenarios

#### Files Created:
- `src/content/inspection-mode-manager.ts` - Inspection mode management implementation
- `__tests__/content/inspection-mode-manager.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite with 24 test cases
- `docs/adr/ADR-004-inspection-mode-manager-architecture.md` - Architecture decision record

#### Next Agent Context:
- Inspection mode management complete with robust state coordination
- Service worker communication established for cross-component integration
- Ready for service worker implementation (Task 6.1) to handle inspection mode messages
- Callback system enables integration with element highlighter and popup components
- Foundation established for complete inspection workflow coordination
