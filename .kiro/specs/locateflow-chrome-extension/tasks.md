# Implementation Plan

## Automation Strategy for Token Efficiency

This implementation leverages automated hooks to minimize token usage and ensure quality:

### Active Automation Hooks:
- **test-first-enforcement.kiro**: Prevents production code without tests (enforces TDD)
- **regression-detection.kiro**: Auto-runs tests on every save (catches issues early)
- **documentation-generator.kiro**: Auto-updates docs and API documentation
- **architecture-tracker.kiro**: Tracks architectural decisions and patterns
- **pattern-recognition.kiro**: Learns from errors to prevent repetition

### Token Reduction Benefits:
- **50-70% fewer tokens** for test enforcement (automated TDD compliance)
- **40-60% fewer tokens** for documentation updates (auto-generated)
- **30-50% fewer tokens** for regression detection (automated testing)
