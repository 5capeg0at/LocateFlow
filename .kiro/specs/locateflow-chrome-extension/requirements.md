# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LocateFlow is a Chrome Extension designed for real-time web element inspection and accurate locator generation. The extension provides developers and QA engineers with multiple locator strategies (CSS, XPath, ID, Class, Name, Tag) with confidence scoring to help identify the most reliable selectors for web automation and testing. The extension prioritizes user privacy by processing all data client-side and includes accessibility features, history tracking, and customizable user preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to inspect web elements in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and generate reliable locators for automation testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates the extension THEN the system SHALL enable element inspection mode on the current web page
2. WHEN the user hovers over a web element THEN the system SHALL highlight the element with a visual indicator
3. WHEN the user clicks on a highlighted element THEN the system SHALL capture the element and generate locators
4. WHEN element inspection is active THEN the system SHALL prevent normal page interactions until inspection mode is disabled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want multiple locator strategies with confidence scoring, so that I can choose the most reliable selector for my test automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate CSS selectors with confidence scores
2. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate XPath expressions with confidence scores
3. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate ID-based locators when available with confidence scores
4. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate Class-based locators with confidence scores
5. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate Name-based locators when available with confidence scores
6. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL generate Tag-based locators with confidence scores
7. WHEN confidence scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL rank locators from most to least reliable
8. WHEN multiple locators are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in order of confidence score

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all data processing to happen client-side, so that my browsing data and inspected elements remain private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension processes web elements THEN the system SHALL perform all analysis locally in the browser
2. WHEN locators are generated THEN the system SHALL NOT send any data to external servers
3. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL NOT require network permissions for core functionality
4. WHEN user preferences are stored THEN the system SHALL store them locally using Chrome's storage API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with accessible applications, I want ARIA accessibility information included in locator generation, so that I can create more robust and accessible test automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element has ARIA attributes THEN the system SHALL include them in locator suggestions
2. WHEN generating locators THEN the system SHALL prioritize accessibility-friendly selectors
3. WHEN an element has role attributes THEN the system SHALL include role-based locator options
4. WHEN an element has aria-label or aria-labelledby THEN the system SHALL suggest locators using these attributes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who frequently inspects elements, I want to capture screenshots of selected elements, so that I can document and reference the elements later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element is selected THEN the system SHALL provide an option to capture a screenshot
2. WHEN a screenshot is captured THEN the system SHALL include only the selected element and its immediate context
3. WHEN a screenshot is taken THEN the system SHALL save it locally or provide download functionality
4. WHEN capturing screenshots THEN the system SHALL maintain element highlighting for clear identification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frequent user of the extension, I want to access my recent locators history, so that I can quickly reuse previously generated selectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN locators are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically save them to local history
2. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display recent locators with timestamps
3. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL allow users to copy locators with one click
4. WHEN history reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL remove oldest entries automatically
5. WHEN the user requests THEN the system SHALL allow clearing of locator history
6. WHEN displaying history THEN the system SHALL show the associated webpage URL and element context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with visual preferences, I want customizable user preferences including dark mode, so that I can use the extension comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide a dark mode toggle option
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme to all extension UI components
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme to element highlighting overlays
4. WHEN the user changes theme preference THEN the system SHALL persist the setting across browser sessions
5. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL apply the user's saved theme preference
6. WHEN system theme changes THEN the system SHALL optionally follow system theme if user preference is set to auto

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Chrome user, I want the extension to be fully compatible with Manifest V3, so that it works with current and future versions of Chrome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN the system SHALL use Manifest V3 specification
2. WHEN the extension requires permissions THEN the system SHALL use Manifest V3 permission model
3. WHEN the extension uses background scripts THEN the system SHALL use service workers instead of background pages
4. WHEN the extension injects content scripts THEN the system SHALL comply with Manifest V3 content security policies
5. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL work on Chrome browsers supporting Manifest V3

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user of the extension, I want an intuitive popup interface, so that I can easily access all features and view generated locators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon THEN the system SHALL display a popup with main controls
2. WHEN the popup is open THEN the system SHALL show toggle for element inspection mode
3. WHEN locators are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in the popup with copy buttons
4. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL show recent locators history section
5. WHEN the popup is open THEN the system SHALL provide access to settings and preferences
6. WHEN the popup interface loads THEN the system SHALL apply the user's selected theme

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer debugging locator reliability, I want detailed confidence scoring explanations, so that I can understand why certain locators are ranked higher than others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN confidence scores are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide explanations for scoring criteria
2. WHEN a locator has high confidence THEN the system SHALL indicate the factors contributing to reliability
3. WHEN a locator has low confidence THEN the system SHALL warn about potential reliability issues
4. WHEN multiple elements match a locator THEN the system SHALL reduce confidence score and indicate ambiguity
5. WHEN a locator uses stable attributes THEN the system SHALL increase confidence score accordingly
