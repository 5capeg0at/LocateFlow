# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LocateFlow is a Chrome Extension designed for real-time web element inspection and accurate locator generation. By hovering over elements, users can instantly view and copy a variety of locators from an on-page UI. The extension prioritizes user privacy by processing all data client-side and includes accessibility analysis, history tracking, and customizable preferences.

## Functional Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Element Inspection and Locator Generation

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to hover over web elements and instantly see a list of locators, so that I can quickly analyze and copy them for automation testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN the user activates the extension's inspection mode, THEN the system SHALL enable element inspection on the current web page.
2.  WHEN the user hovers over a web element, THEN the system SHALL highlight the element with a visual indicator and display an on-page popup nearby.
3.  WHEN the on-page popup appears, THEN the system SHALL display a list of generated locators.
4.  WHEN the user clicks on a highlighted element (without the `Ctrl` key held), THEN the system SHALL copy the highest-rated locator to the clipboard.
5.  WHEN the user holds the `Ctrl` key, THEN the system SHALL freeze the on-page popup, allowing the user to move the mouse over the popup to interact with its UI.
6.  WHEN element inspection is active, THEN the system SHALL prevent default page interactions (e.g., clicking links) until inspection mode is disabled.

### Requirement 2: Interactive On-Page Locator UI

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want an interactive on-page UI with multiple locator strategies and hotkey support, so that I can efficiently choose the most reliable selector for my tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN an element is hovered, THEN the system SHALL generate and display locators for CSS, XPath, ID, Class, Name, and Tag strategies.
2.  WHEN locators are displayed in the on-page popup, THEN each locator option SHALL have a dedicated "copy" button.
3.  WHEN the on-page popup is visible, THEN it SHALL feature a tabbed interface to organize different views (e.g., Locators, ARIA).
4.  WHEN the on-page popup is visible, THEN the user SHALL be able to switch between tabs using keyboard hotkeys (1, 2, 3...).

### Requirement 3: Detailed Confidence Scoring

**User Story:** As a developer debugging locator reliability, I want detailed confidence scoring explanations, so that I can understand why certain locators are ranked higher than others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN confidence scores are displayed, THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations or tooltips for the scoring criteria.
2.  WHEN a locator has high confidence, THEN the system SHALL indicate the factors contributing to its reliability (e.g., uses a unique ID).
3.  WHEN a locator has low confidence, THEN the system SHALL warn about potential fragility (e.g., auto-generated classes, ambiguity).
4.  WHEN a generated locator matches multiple elements on the page, THEN the system SHALL lower its confidence score and indicate the ambiguity.

---

### Requirement 4: Accessibility (ARIA) Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer working with accessible applications, I want to generate an ARIA snapshot and get accessibility-focused locators, so that I can create more robust and accessible test automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN the on-page popup is displayed, THEN it SHALL contain a dedicated "ARIA" tab.
2.  WHEN an element has ARIA attributes (e.g., `role`, `aria-label`), THEN the system SHALL use them to suggest accessibility-friendly locators in the main locators tab.
3.  WHEN the user navigates to the ARIA tab, THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate an "ARIA Snapshot" of the selected element.
4.  WHEN an ARIA snapshot is generated, THEN the system SHALL provide an option to display the detailed snapshot in a new browser window or tab.

---

### Requirement 5: Locator History in Main Extension Popup

**User Story:** As a frequent user, I want to access my recent locators from the main extension window, so that I can quickly reuse previously generated selectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a locator is copied, THEN the system SHALL automatically save it to a local history log.
2.  WHEN the user clicks the extension toolbar icon, THEN the system SHALL display a popup window with the main controls and the locator history.
3.  WHEN history is displayed, THEN each entry SHALL show the locator, the URL of the page, and a timestamp.
4.  WHEN viewing history, THEN the user SHALL be able to copy any locator with a single click.
5.  WHEN the user requests, THEN the system SHALL allow the entire locator history to be cleared.
6.  WHEN history reaches its storage capacity, THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the oldest entries first.
7.  WHEN the main popup is displayed, THEN it SHALL provide access to a settings page.

---

### Requirement 6: Customizable User Preferences

**User Story:** As a user with visual preferences, I want customizable user preferences including dark mode, so that I can use the extension comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN the user opens the extension settings, THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle option for dark mode.
2.  WHEN dark mode is enabled, THEN the system SHALL apply a dark theme to all UI components, including the main popup and the on-page inspection popup.
3.  WHEN the user changes a theme preference, THEN the system SHALL persist the setting across browser sessions using local storage.
4.  WHEN the user sets the theme preference to "auto", THEN the extension's theme SHALL automatically match the system's theme.

---

### Requirement 7: Client-Side Privacy

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all data processing to happen client-side, so that my Browse data and inspected elements remain private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN the extension processes web elements, THEN all analysis SHALL be performed locally within the browser.
2.  WHEN locators are generated or history is saved, THEN no data SHALL be sent to external servers.
3.  WHEN the extension is installed, THEN it SHALL NOT require network permissions for its core functionality.
4.  WHEN user preferences are stored, THEN the system SHALL use Chrome's local storage API.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.  **Platform Compatibility:** The extension MUST be built using the Manifest V3 specification to ensure full compatibility with current and future versions of Google Chrome. All background scripts must be implemented as service workers.
2.  **Error Handling:** All runtime errors and exceptions SHALL be logged to the browser's Developer Tools console for debugging purposes. The extension UI should fail gracefully without crashing the user's browser tab.
