- Created comprehensive implementation context
- Established traceability to requirements
- Verified code quality standards

## Requirements Traceability

### Non-Functional Requirement 1: Platform Compatibility
**Requirement:** "The extension MUST be built using the Manifest V3 specification"
**Implementation:** 
- ✅ `manifest.json` uses `"manifest_version": 3`
- ✅ Background script configured as service worker
- ✅ Proper permissions and host_permissions structure
- ✅ Tests validate Manifest V3 compliance

### Testing Framework Requirements
**Derived from TDD methodology requirements:**
- ✅ Jest testing framework with JSDOM environment
- ✅ Chrome API mocking capabilities
- ✅ Coverage thresholds: 90% lines, 85% branches
- ✅ TypeScript integration for type safety
- ✅ ESLint for code quality enforcement

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Testing Strategy
**Decision:** Use Jest with JSDOM and custom Chrome API mocks
**Rationale:** Provides comprehensive testing environment for Chrome extensions
**Impact:** Enables reliable unit testing of DOM manipulation and Chrome API interactions

### 2. Project Structure
**Decision:** Modular directory structure with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale:** Supports scalability and maintainability as extension grows
**Impact:** Clear boundaries between content scripts, background, UI components

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
**Decision:** Strict TypeScript with comprehensive type checking
**Rationale:** Prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
**Impact:** Enhanced code reliability and better IDE support

### 4. Quality Gates
**Decision:** Automated linting, testing, and coverage requirements
**Rationale:** Ensures consistent code quality and prevents regressions
**Impact:** Higher confidence in code changes and easier maintenance

## Development Patterns Established

### 1. Test-First Development
- All production code must have failing tests first
- Tests define expected behavior before implementation
- Minimal implementation to pass tests, then refactor

### 2. Chrome Extension Testing
- Use `mockChromeAPI()` for Chrome extension API testing
- Use `createMockElement()` and `createMockDOM()` for DOM testing
- Global test setup in `__tests__/setup.js`

### 3. Code Organization
- Separate concerns: content scripts, background, popup, options, shared
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules for consistent style

## Next Development Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks (from tasks.md):
1. **Task 2.1**: Implement content script injection and activation system
2. **Task 2.2**: Create element highlighting and visual feedback system
3. **Task 2.3**: Build hover detection and event handling

### Development Context for Future Agents:
- **Testing Environment**: Fully configured with Chrome API mocks and DOM utilities
- **Quality Standards**: 90% coverage minimum, ESLint compliance required
- **Architecture**: Modular structure ready for feature implementation
- **TDD Workflow**: Established pattern of RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles

## Environment-Specific Notes

### Windows Development Environment:
- Using PowerShell commands for npm operations
- File paths use forward slashes in configuration
- ESLint configured for cross-platform compatibility

### Chrome Extension Specifics:
- Manifest V3 service worker architecture
- Content script injection patterns established
- Chrome API mocking utilities ready for use

## Quality Metrics Achieved

- **Test Coverage**: 100% of implemented code (minimal baseline)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules enforced, TypeScript strict mode
- **Documentation**: ADR created, implementation context documented
- **Traceability**: Requirements mapped to implementation decisions

This foundation provides a solid base for implementing the LocateFlow Chrome Extension features with confidence in code quality and maintainability.
