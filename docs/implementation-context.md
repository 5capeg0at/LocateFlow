### Task 4.5: Implement confidence scoring algorithm with TDD
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** 2025-07-24

#### TDD Cycle Summary:
- **RED Phase:** Created 33 failing tests defining unified confidence scoring algorithm
- **GREEN Phase:** Implemented `ConfidenceScoringEngine` class with minimal code to pass all tests
- **REFACTOR Phase:** Enhanced documentation and created comprehensive ADR

#### Requirements Traceability:
- ✅ Requirement 3.1: Confidence scoring with detailed explanations
- ✅ Requirement 3.2: Confidence scoring for locator reliability with detailed factors
- ✅ Requirement 3.3: Warnings for low confidence scores with specific messages
- ✅ Requirement 3.4: Uniqueness validation and stability assessment across all locator types

#### Architecture Decisions:
- ADR-009: Unified Confidence Scoring Engine with centralized algorithm
- Multi-factor scoring: Uniqueness (40%) + Stability (35%) + Type Reliability (15%) + Pattern Analysis (10%)
- Hierarchical strategy comparison: Type > Uniqueness > Confidence Score
- Comprehensive pattern detection for auto-generated and fragile selectors

#### Implementation Details:
- **Core Class:** `ConfidenceScoringEngine` with unified scoring algorithm
- **Key Methods:**
  - `calculateConfidenceScore()` - Main confidence assessment with detailed factors
  - `assessStability()` - Type-specific stability scoring (0-100 scale)
  - `detectPatterns()` - Pattern recognition for reliability assessment
  - `generateExplanation()` - Human-readable confidence explanations
  - `compareStrategies()` - Hierarchical strategy ranking
- **Pattern Detection:** Auto-generated, position-based, semantic, accessibility, utility, BEM patterns
- **Stability Algorithms:** Type-specific scoring for ID, Class, Name, Tag, CSS, XPath, ARIA selectors

#### Quality Metrics:
- **Test Coverage:** 100% line coverage with 33 comprehensive test cases
- **Tests:** 33/33 passing with edge cases and error handling
- **Code Quality:** ESLint compliant, follows SOLID principles
- **Documentation:** Complete ADR with algorithm details and architectural decisions

#### Files Created:
- `src/shared/confidence-scoring-engine.ts` - Unified confidence scoring engine
- `__tests__/shared/confidence-scoring-engine.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `docs/adr/ADR-009-confidence-scoring-engine.md` - Architecture decision record

#### Next Agent Context:
- Unified confidence scoring engine provides consistent assessment across all locator types
- Comprehensive pattern detection identifies auto-generated and fragile selectors
- Ready for integration with content script and locator generation workflow (Task 5.1)
- Foundation established for cross-strategy comparison and optimal locator selection

#### TDD Methodology Compliance:
- ✅ **RED Phase:** All 33 tests written before implementation
- ✅ **GREEN Phase:** Minimal implementation to pass tests
- ✅ **REFACTOR Phase:** Code organization and documentation improvements
- ✅ **Quality Gates:** 100% test coverage, comprehensive edge case handling
- ✅ **Architecture Documentation:** ADR created with detailed algorithm explanation
