# ADR-004: Inspection Mode Manager Architecture

Date: 2025-07-28
Status: Accepted
Deciders: LocateFlow Development Team

## Context

Task 5.5 required implementing inspection mode management with TDD approach, including:
- Inspection mode activation and deactivation
- Page interaction prevention during inspection mode
- Service worker communication for mode state management

The system needed to coordinate between content scripts and service workers while preventing default page interactions during inspection mode.

## Decision

Implemented a centralized `InspectionModeManager` class with the following architecture:

### Core Design Principles:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Focused solely on inspection mode state management
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses DOM event capture for interaction prevention
3. **Service Worker Integration**: Bidirectional communication for state coordination
4. **Callback System**: Enables loose coupling with other components
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all failure scenarios

### Key Components:

#### State Management:
- Boolean flag for inspection mode state
- Prevents duplicate activations/deactivations
- Thread-safe state transitions

#### Event Handling:
- Capture phase event listeners for click and submit events
- Prevents default behavior during inspection mode
- Automatic cleanup on deactivation

#### Service Worker Communication:
- Sends activation/deactivation messages to service worker
- Listens for commands from service worker
- Handles communication failures gracefully

#### Integration Points:
- Callback registration for mode change notifications
- Support for multiple callback registrations
- Clean separation from other content script components

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Inspection mode logic isolated in dedicated class
- **Robust Error Handling**: All DOM and communication errors handled gracefully
- **Testable Architecture**: 100% test coverage with comprehensive edge cases
- **Service Worker Ready**: Prepared for Manifest V3 service worker integration
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new interaction types or communication channels

### Negative:
- **Additional Complexity**: Introduces another class to the content script layer
- **Service Worker Dependency**: Requires service worker implementation for full functionality
- **Event Listener Overhead**: Capture phase listeners may impact page performance

### Mitigation:
- **Performance**: Event listeners only active during inspection mode
- **Service Worker**: Graceful degradation when service worker unavailable
- **Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation and clear API design

## Implementation Notes

### TDD Approach:
- 24 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle followed strictly
- Edge cases and error scenarios thoroughly tested

### Error Handling Strategy:
- All DOM operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Service worker communication failures logged but don't break functionality
- Event prevention errors handled gracefully

### Integration Requirements:
- Must be instantiated in content script
- Service worker must handle `INSPECTION_MODE_ACTIVATED` and `INSPECTION_MODE_DEACTIVATED` messages
- Other components can register callbacks for mode changes

### Future Enhancements:
- Support for additional event types (keyboard, mouse)
- Configurable interaction prevention rules
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Integration with Chrome DevTools Protocol
