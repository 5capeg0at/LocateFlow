## Context

The LocateFlow Chrome Extension requires a robust element highlighting system for DOM interaction during inspection mode. The system must provide visual feedback when users hover over elements, prevent default page interactions, and integrate seamlessly with the content script architecture.

Key requirements:
- Requirement 1.2: Element highlighting with visual indicator on hover
- Requirement 1.6: Prevent default page interactions during inspection mode
- Must support event-driven architecture for external integration
- Must handle errors gracefully without crashing the page
- Must be performant and not interfere with page functionality

## Decision

We have implemented the ElementHighlighter class with the following architectural decisions:

### 1. Single Responsibility Design
- **Decision**: Create a dedicated class focused solely on element highlighting
- **Rationale**: Follows SOLID principles and enables easier testing and maintenance
- **Implementation**: ElementHighlighter class with clear public API

### 2. Event Delegation Pattern
- **Decision**: Use event delegation with capture phase for DOM event handling
- **Rationale**: More efficient than adding listeners to individual elements, better control over event flow
- **Implementation**: Single listeners on document.body with capture: true

### 3. Overlay-Based Visual Feedback
- **Decision**: Create fixed-position overlay elements for highlighting
- **Rationale**: Non-intrusive, doesn't affect page layout, easily styled and positioned
- **Implementation**: Dynamic div creation with fixed positioning and high z-index

### 4. Callback-Based Integration
- **Decision**: Provide onHover/onUnhover callback registration for external integration
- **Rationale**: Enables loose coupling with other components, supports event-driven architecture
- **Implementation**: Array-based callback storage with forEach notification

### 5. Graceful Error Handling
- **Decision**: Catch and log errors without throwing, maintain system stability
- **Rationale**: Chrome extension must not crash user's browsing experience
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with console.warn logging

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **High Performance**: Event delegation reduces memory overhead
- **Robust Error Handling**: System continues functioning even with DOM errors
- **Clean Integration**: Callback system enables loose coupling with other components
- **Testable Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns enables comprehensive unit testing
- **User Experience**: Non-intrusive highlighting doesn't affect page layout
- **Maintainable Code**: Single responsibility makes future changes easier

### Negative:
- **Memory Usage**: Overlay elements consume additional DOM memory
- **Event Complexity**: Event delegation requires careful handling of event propagation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fixed positioning may have edge cases in some browsers

### Mitigation:
- **Memory Management**: Overlays are removed immediately when not needed
- **Event Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covers event handling edge cases
- **Browser Testing**: Target modern Chrome versions with known fixed positioning support

## Implementation Notes

### Core Methods:
- `enableInspectionMode()`: Activates highlighting with event listener registration
- `disableInspectionMode()`: Deactivates highlighting and cleans up resources
- `highlightElement(element)`: Creates visual overlay for specified element
- `removeHighlight()`: Removes current overlay and notifies callbacks

### Event Handling:
- **Mouseover**: Triggers element highlighting
- **Mouseout**: Removes highlighting with child element detection
- **Click**: Prevents default behavior during inspection mode

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- Null element references
- getBoundingClientRect failures
- DOM manipulation errors
- Event listener registration failures

### Integration Points:
- Callback registration for hover/unhover events
- State management for inspection mode
- DOM event prevention during inspection

### Testing Strategy:
- 95.89% statement coverage achieved through TDD
- 86.66% branch coverage with comprehensive edge case testing
- Mock-based testing for DOM APIs and event handling
- Error scenario testing for graceful degradation

This architecture provides a solid foundation for element highlighting while maintaining the flexibility needed for future enhancements and integrations.
