# ADR-001: Project Structure and Testing Framework Setup

Date: 2025-07-24
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Development Team

## Context

We need to establish a robust foundation for the LocateFlow Chrome Extension that supports Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensures code quality, and provides a scalable architecture for future development. The extension must comply with Chrome Manifest V3 specifications and maintain high test coverage standards.

## Decision

We have chosen to implement a comprehensive project structure with the following key components:

### Project Structure
- **Manifest V3 Configuration**: Full compliance with Chrome extension standards
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate directories for content scripts, background, popup, options, and shared utilities
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Jest Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing with JSDOM and Chrome API mocking

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-First Development**: All production code must have corresponding failing tests before implementation
- **Chrome API Mocking**: Custom utilities for mocking Chrome extension APIs
- **DOM Testing**: JSDOM integration for testing DOM manipulation
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage

### Quality Gates
- **ESLint Configuration**: Automated code quality enforcement
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enhanced type safety
- **Automated Testing**: Jest with coverage reporting

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **High Code Quality**: Enforced through linting and testing requirements
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive tooling and testing utilities
- **Future-Proof**: Manifest V3 compliance ensures long-term compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: High confidence in code reliability through comprehensive testing

### Negative:
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: More configuration files and dependencies
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand TDD methodology and testing utilities
- **Build Time**: Additional compilation and testing steps

### Mitigation:
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage documentation
- **Test Helpers**: Pre-built utilities to simplify Chrome API and DOM testing
- **Automation**: Automated quality checks and test execution

## Implementation Notes

### Key Files Created:
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compilation settings
- `jest.config.js`: Testing framework configuration
- `.eslintrc.js`: Code quality rules
- `manifest.json`: Chrome extension configuration
- `__tests__/helpers/test-helpers.js`: Testing utilities
- `__tests__/setup.js`: Global test environment setup

### Testing Utilities:
- `createMockElement()`: Creates mock DOM elements with attributes
- `createMockDOM()`: Builds complete DOM structures for testing
- `mockChromeAPI()`: Mocks Chrome extension APIs
- `setupDOMEnvironment()`: Configures JSDOM for testing
- `cleanupDOMEnvironment()`: Cleans up test environment

### Quality Standards:
- All public methods must have tests
- Minimum 90% line coverage required
- ESLint rules enforce consistent code style
- TypeScript strict mode prevents common errors

This foundation enables confident, test-driven development of the LocateFlow Chrome Extension while maintaining high quality standards and ensuring long-term maintainability.
