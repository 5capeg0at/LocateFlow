# ADR-005: CSS Selector Generation Engine

Date: 2025-07-24
Status: Accepted
Deciders: LocateFlow Development Team

## Context

The LocateFlow Chrome Extension requires a robust CSS selector generation system that can create reliable, stable, and unique selectors for DOM elements. The system must prioritize different selector strategies based on reliability and provide confidence scoring to help users understand selector quality.

## Decision

We have implemented a priority-based CSS selector generation engine with the following architecture:

### Priority Strategy:
1. **ID-based selectors** (highest reliability) - `#elementId`
2. **Attribute-based selectors** (form elements) - `input[name="username"]`
3. **Class-based selectors** - `button.btn.btn-primary`
4. **Hierarchy-based selectors** - `div.container > button.btn`
5. **Tag-based selectors** (fallback) - `input`

### Core Components:
- `CSSelectorGenerator` class with comprehensive selector generation
- Real-time uniqueness validation using `document.querySelectorAll()`
- Stability scoring algorithm (0-100 scale)
- Multi-factor confidence assessment with detailed explanations

### Key Features:
- Auto-generated class name detection and warnings
- Hierarchy building for non-unique selectors
- Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Integration with `LocatorStrategy` interface

## Consequences

### Positive:
- High reliability through priority-based strategy selection
- Real-time DOM validation ensures selector uniqueness
- Detailed confidence scoring helps users make informed decisions
- Comprehensive test coverage (95.37%) ensures reliability
- Clean architecture supports future extensions

### Negative:
- DOM querying for validation may impact performance on large pages
- Complex hierarchy building logic requires careful maintenance
- Auto-generated class detection patterns may need updates over time

### Mitigation:
- Implement caching for repeated selector validation
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize DOM queries if needed
- Maintain pattern recognition rules through user feedback and testing
- Document all selector generation strategies for maintainability

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Details:
- Uses native DOM APIs for maximum compatibility
- Follows TDD methodology with 20 comprehensive test cases
- Implements SOLID principles for maintainable code
- Provides detailed JSDoc documentation

### Integration Points:
- Integrates with shared data models (`LocatorStrategy`, `ConfidenceScore`)
- Compatible with Chrome extension content script environment
- Supports future locator strategy aggregation systems

### Quality Gates:
- Minimum 90% test coverage requirement met (95.37% achieved)
- ESLint compliance for code quality
- Comprehensive error handling for production reliability
