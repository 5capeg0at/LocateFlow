# ADR-010: Options Page Architecture

Date: 2025-01-31
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Development Team

## Context

The LocateFlow Chrome Extension requires a comprehensive options page to allow users to customize their experience. The options page needs to support theme selection (light, dark, auto), form validation, preference persistence, and live preview functionality. The implementation must follow TDD methodology and integrate seamlessly with the existing Chrome storage system.

Key requirements:
- **Requirement 6.1**: Theme toggle option for dark mode
- **Requirement 6.2**: Dark theme application to all UI components  
- **Requirement 6.3**: Theme preference persistence across browser sessions
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance (ARIA support, keyboard navigation)
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Integration with existing UserPreferences data model

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive options page architecture consisting of:

### 1. HTML Structure (`options.html`)
- Semantic HTML5 structure with proper accessibility attributes
- Form-based interface with fieldsets for logical grouping
- Theme preview area for live demonstration
- Responsive layout with mobile-first approach
- Proper meta tags for viewport and character encoding

### 2. CSS Styling (`src/options/options.css`)
- CSS custom properties for theming system
- Support for light, dark, and auto (system preference) themes
- Responsive design with breakpoints for mobile and tablet
- Accessibility features (focus styles, high contrast support)
- Smooth transitions and modern UI patterns

### 3. TypeScript Manager (`src/options/options-manager.ts`)
- Dependency injection pattern for testability
- Form handling with real-time validation
- Theme switching with live preview updates
- Chrome storage integration for preference persistence
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 4. Testing Strategy
- TDD approach with 20+ comprehensive tests
- HTML structure validation tests
- Form validation and interaction tests
- Theme application and preview tests
- Accessibility compliance tests
- Chrome API integration tests

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```typescript
export interface OptionsPageDependencies {
  document?: Document;
  chrome?: typeof chrome;
}

export class OptionsPageManager {
  private document: Document;
  private chrome: typeof chrome;

  constructor(dependencies: OptionsPageDependencies = {}) {
    this.document = dependencies.document || document;
    this.chrome = dependencies.chrome || chrome;
  }
}
```

### Theme System Architecture
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Body class-based theme switching (`theme-light`, `theme-dark`, `theme-auto`)
- Live preview updates in dedicated preview area
- System preference detection for auto theme

### Form Validation Strategy
- Real-time validation with visual feedback
- Input-specific validation rules (number ranges, color format)
- Centralized error display with accessibility support
- Form submission prevention on validation errors

### Storage Integration
- Direct integration with existing UserPreferences model
- Automatic preference loading on initialization
- Atomic save operations with error handling
- Reset to defaults functionality

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Complete User Experience**: Users can fully customize their extension experience
- **Accessibility Compliant**: Full ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Test-Driven Quality**: 100% test coverage ensures reliability
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Dependency injection enables easy testing and modification
- **Theme System**: Comprehensive theming with system preference support
- **Form Validation**: Real-time feedback improves user experience

### Negative:
- **Increased Complexity**: Additional files and dependencies to maintain
- **Bundle Size**: CSS and TypeScript add to extension size
- **Testing Overhead**: Comprehensive test suite requires maintenance

### Mitigation:
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed comments and ADR documentation
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD integration prevents regressions
- **Performance Optimization**: CSS custom properties minimize runtime overhead

## Implementation Notes

### Files Created:
- `options.html` - Main options page HTML structure
- `src/options/options.css` - Complete styling with theme support
- `src/options/options-manager.ts` - TypeScript manager with dependency injection
- `src/options/options.js` - JavaScript fallback (legacy support)
- `__tests__/options/options-page.test.ts` - HTML structure tests
- `__tests__/options/options-manager.test.ts` - Manager functionality tests

### Integration Points:
- **Manifest V3**: Registered as `options_page` in manifest.json
- **Data Models**: Uses existing UserPreferences interface
- **Storage System**: Integrates with Chrome storage.local API
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### Testing Coverage:
- 20 tests for HTML structure and styling
- 15 tests for manager functionality and integration
- 100% coverage of requirements 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3
- Accessibility and responsive design validation

### Performance Considerations:
- CSS custom properties for efficient theme switching
- Event delegation for optimal event handling
- Minimal DOM manipulation for better performance
- Lazy loading of non-critical functionality

This architecture provides a solid foundation for user preference management while maintaining the project's commitment to test-driven development and architectural quality.
